Title "Natural Number Game"
Introduction

# Welcome to the Natural Number Game
#### An introduction to mathematical proof.

In this game, we will build the basic theory of the natural
numbers `{0,1,2,3,4,...}` from scratch. Our first goal is to prove
that `2 + 2 = 4`. Next we'll prove that `x + y = y + x`.
And at the end we'll see if we can prove Fermat's Last Theorem.
We'll do this by solving levels of a computer puzzle game called Lean.

# Read this.

Learning how to use an interactive theorem prover takes time.
Tests show that the people who get the most out of this game are
those who read the help texts like this one.

To start, click on \"Tutorial World\".

Note: this is a preliminary new Lean 4 version of the game; new versions
of inequality and advanced addition/multiplication worlds are in preparation.
Other brand new worlds will also be appearing during October 2023.
