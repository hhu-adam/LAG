# Bonus Peano Axioms level

If this becomes a level:

Explain that Peano had two extra axioms:

succ_inj (a b : ℕ) :
  succ a = succ b → a = b

zero_ne_succ (a : ℕ) :
  zero ≠ succ a

In Lean we don't need these axioms though, because they
follow from Lean's principles of reduction and recursion.

Principle of recursion: if two things are true:
* I know how to do it for 0
* Assuming (only) that I know how to do it for n.
  I know how to do it for n+1.

Note the "only".

## pred

pred(x)=x-1, at least when x > 0. If x=0 then there's no
answer so we just let the answer be a junk value because
it's the simplest way of dealing with this case.
If a mathematician asks us what pred of 0 is, we tell
them that it's a stupid question by saying 37, it's
like a poo emoji. But Peano was a cultured mathematician
and this proof of `succ_inj` will only use `pred` on
positive naturals, just like today's cultured mathematician
never divides by zero.

We need to learn how to deal wiht a goal of the form `P → Q`

What does `≠` even *mean*?

By *definition*, `zero ≠ succ a` *means* `zero = succ a → false`
