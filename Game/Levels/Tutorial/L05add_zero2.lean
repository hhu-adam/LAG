Introduction

## Precision rewriting

In the last level, there was `b + 0` and `c + 0`,
and `rw [add_zero]` changed the first one it saw,
which was `b + 0`. Let's learn how to tell Lean
to change `c + 0` first by giving `add_zero` an
explicit input.

namespace MyNat

/-- $a+(b+0)+(c+0)=a+b+c.$ -/
Statement (a b c : â„•) : a + (b + 0) + (c + 0) = a + b + c := by
  Hint "Try `rw [add_zero c]`."
  rw [add_zero c]
  Hint "You can now change `b + 0` to `b` with `rw [add_zero]` or `rw [add_zero b]`. It's
  usually easiest to stick to `add_zero` if it works though."
  rw [add_zero]

LemmaTab "Add"

Conclusion "
Let's now learn about Peano's second axiom for addition, `add_succ`.
