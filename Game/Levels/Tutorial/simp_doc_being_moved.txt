TacticDoc simp "The simplifier. `rw` on steroids.

A bunch of lemmas like `add_zero : âˆ€ a, a + 0 = a`
are tagged with the `@[simp]` tag. If the `simp` tactic
is run by the user, the simplifier will try and rewrite
as many of the lemmas tagged `@[simp]` as it can.

`simp` is a *finishing tactic*. After you run `simp`,
the goal should be closed. If it is not, it is best
practice to write `simp?` instead and then replace the
output with the appropriate `simp only` call. Inappropriate
use of `simp` can make for very slow code.
