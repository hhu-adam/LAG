Introduction
"
## The birth of number.

Numbers in Lean are defined by two rules.

* `0` is a number.
* If `n` is a number, then the *successor* `succ n` of `n` is a number.

The successor of `n` means the number after `n`. Let's learn to
count, and name a few small numbers.

## Counting to four.

`0` is a number, so `succ 0` is a number. Let's call this new number `1`.
Similarly let's define `2 = succ 1`, `3 = succ 2` and `4 = succ 3`.
This gives us plenty of numbers to be getting along with.

The *proof* that `3 = succ 2` is called `three_eq_succ_two`.
Check out the \"numerals\" tab in the list of lemmas on the right.

  Hint "Start with `rw [three_eq_succ_two]` to begin to break `3` down."

  Hint (hidden := true) "If you're in a hurry, try `rw [two_eq_succ_one, one_eq_succ_zero]`."
  rw [two_eq_succ_one]
  rw [one_eq_succ_zero]
  Hint (hidden := true) "Now finish the job with `rfl`."

DefinitionDoc MyNat as "ℕ"
"
`ℕ` is the natural numbers, just called \"numbers\" in this game. It's
defined via two rules:

* `0 : ℕ` (zero is a number)
* `succ (n : ℕ) : ℕ` (the successor of a number is a number)

## Game Implementation

*The game uses its own copy of the natural numbers, called `MyNat` with notation `ℕ`.
It is distinct from the Lean natural numbers `Nat`, which should hopefully
never leak into the natural number game.*"

Conclusion
"
Note that you can do
`rw [three_eq_succ_two, two_eq_succ_one, one_eq_succ_zero]`
and then `rfl` to solve this level in two lines.

Why did we not just define `succ n` to be `n + 1`? Because we have not
even *defined* addition yet! We'll do that in the next level.
