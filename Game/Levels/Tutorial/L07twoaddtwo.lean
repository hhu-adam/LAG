Introduction
" Good luck!

  One last hint. If `h : X = Y` then `rw [h]` will change *all* `X`s into `Y`s.
  If you only want to change one of them, say the 3rd one, then use
  `nth_rewrite 3 [h]`.

## Summary

If `h : X = Y` and there are several `X`s in the goal, then
`nth_rewrite 3 [h]` will just change the third `X` to a `Y`.

## Example

If the goal is `2 + 2 = 4` then `nth_rewrite 2 [two_eq_succ_one]`
will change the goal to `2 + succ 1 = 4`. In contrast, `rw [two_eq_succ_one]`
will change the goal to `succ 1 + succ 1 = 4`.

Conclusion

  Here is an example proof showing off various techniques. You can copy
  and paste it directly into Lean if you switch into editor mode, and then
  you can inspect it by clicking around within the proof or moving your cursor
  down the lines.
  Click on `</>` and `>_` in the top right to switch between editor mode
  and command line mode. Switch back to command line mode
  when you've finished, if you prefer to see hints.

```lean
nth_rewrite 2 [two_eq_succ_one]
rw [add_succ]
rw [one_eq_succ_zero]
rw [add_succ, add_zero] -- two rewrites at once
rw [← three_eq_succ_two] -- change `succ 2` to `3`
rw [← four_eq_succ_three]

```

You have finished tutorial world! Now let's move onto Addition World,
and learn the `induction` tactic.
