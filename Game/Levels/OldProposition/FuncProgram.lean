# Bonus Peano Axioms level

Explain that Peano had two extra axioms:

succ_inj (a b : ℕ) :
  succ a = succ b → a = b

zero_ne_succ (a : ℕ) :
  zero ≠ succ a

In Lean we don't need these axioms though, because they
follow from Lean's principles of reduction and recursion.

Principle of recursion: if two things are true:
* I know how to do it for 0
* Assuming (only) that I know how to do it for n.
  I know how to do it for n+1.

Note the "only".

## pred

pred(x)=x-1, at least when x > 0. If x=0 then there's no
answer so we just let the answer be a junk value because
it's the simplest way of dealing with this case.
If a mathematician asks us what pred of 0 is, we tell
them that it's a stupid question by saying 37, it's
like a poo emoji. But Peano was a cultured mathematician
and this proof of `succ_inj` will only use `pred` on
positive naturals, just like today's cultured mathematician
never divides by zero.

We need to learn how to deal wiht a goal of the form `P → Q`

## Interlude ; 3n+1 problem

unsafe def collatz : ℕ → ℕ
| 0 => 37
| 1 => 37
| m => if m % 2 = 0 then collatz (m / 2) else collatz (3 * m + 1)


-- theorem proof_of_collatz_conjecture : ∀ n, ∃ (t : ℕ), collatz ^ t n = 1 := by
--  sorry

Here is a crank proof I was sent of the 3n+1
problem. Explanaiton of problem. Proof: By induction.
Define f(1)=stop.
Got to prove that for all n, it terminates.

For even numbers this is obvious so they're all done.
For odd numbers, if n is odd then 3n+1 is even, but
as we already observed it's obvious for all even numbers,
so we're done.

## zero_ne_succ

zero_ne_succ (a : ℕ) :
  zero ≠ succ a

What does `≠` even *mean*?

By *definition*, `zero ≠ succ a` *means* `zero = succ a → false`

lemma zero_ne_succ (n : ℕ) : 0 ≠ n.succ := by

  apply_fun is_zero at h
  rw [is_zero_zero, is_zero_succ] at h
  cases h -- splits into all the cases where this is true
