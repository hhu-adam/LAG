Introduction "Mathematicians sometimes debate what `0 ^ 0` is;
the answer depends, of course, on your definitions. In this
game, `0 ^ 0 = 1`. See if you can prove it.

Check out the *Pow* tab in your list of theorems
to see the new proofs which are available."

DefinitionDoc Pow as "^" "
  `Pow a b`, with notation `a ^ b`, is the usual
  exponentiation of natural numbers. Internally it is
  defined via two axioms:

  * `pow_zero a : a ^ 0 = 1`

  * `pow_succ a b : a ^ succ b = a ^ b * a`

Note in particular that `0 ^ 0 = 1`.

`pow_zero a : a ^ 0 = 1` is one of the two axioms
defining exponentiation in this game.

LemmaDoc MyNat.zero_pow_zero as "zero_pow_zero" in "Pow" "
Mathematicians sometimes argue that `0 ^ 0 = 0` is also
a good convention. But it is not a good convention in this
game; all the later levels come out beautifully with the
convention that `0 ^ 0 = 1`.
