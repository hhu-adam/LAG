`add_sq a b` is the statment that $(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2+2ab.$

Conclusion
"
It's all over! You have proved a theorem which has tripped up
schoolkids for generations (some of them think $(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2$:
this is \"the freshman's dream\").

How many rewrites did you use? I can do it in 12.

But wait! This boss is stirring...and mutating into a second more powerful form!

-- *TODO* add something like this when the new worlds are written
-- If you didn't play the other worlds like even/odd world yet,
-- then feel free to try these next.
