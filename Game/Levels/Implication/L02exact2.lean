Introduction "If the goal is not *exactly* a hypothesis, we can sometimes
use rewrites to fix things up."

/-- Assuming $0+x=(0+y)+2$, we have $x=y+2$. -/
Statement (x : â„•) (h : 0 + x = 0 + y + 2) : x = y + 2 := by
  Hint "Rewrite `zero_add` at `h` twice, to change `h` into the goal."
  repeat rw [zero_add] at h
  Hint "Now you could finish with `rw [h]` then `rfl`, but `exact h`
  does it in one line."
  exact h

Conclusion "Here's a two-line proof:
```
repeat rw [zero_add] at h
exact h
```
"
