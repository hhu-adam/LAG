## Summary

If the goal is `P → Q`, then `intro h` will introduce `h : P` as a hypothesis,
and change the goal to `Q`. Mathematically, it says that to prove $P\\implies Q$,
we can assume $P$ and then prove $Q$.

### Example:

If your goal is `x + 1 = y + 1 → x = y` (the way Lean writes $x+1=y+1\\implies x=y$)
then `intro h` will give you a hypothesis $x+1=y+1$ named `h`, and the goal
will change to $x=y$.

Introduction
"We have seen how to `apply` theorems and assumptions of
of the form `P → Q`. But what if our *goal* is of the form `P → Q`?
To prove this goal, we need to know how to say \"let's assume `P` and deduce `Q`\"
in Lean. We do this with the `intro` tactic.
