Introduction
"
The first sub-boss of Multiplication World is `mul_comm x y : x * y = y * x`.

When you've proved this theorem we will have \"spare\" proofs
such as `zero_mul`, which is now easily deducible from `mul_zero`.
But we'll keep hold of these proofs anyway, because it's convenient
to have exactly the right tool for a job.

`mul_comm` is the proof that multiplication is commutative. More precisely,
`mul_comm a b` is the proof that `a * b = b * a`.
