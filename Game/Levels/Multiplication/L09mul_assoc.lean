Introduction
"
We now have enough to prove that multiplication is associative,
the boss level of multiplication world. Good luck!

LemmaDoc MyNat.mul_assoc as "mul_assoc" in "Mul" "
`mul_assoc a b c` is a proof that `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.

Note that when Lean says `a * b * c` it means `(a * b) * c`.

Note that `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)` cannot be proved by \"pure thought\":
for example subtraction is not associative, as `(6 - 2) - 1` is not
equal to `6 - (2 - 1)`.
"

/-- Multiplication is associative.
In other words, for all natural numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$, we have
$(ab)c = a(bc)$. -/
