Introduction
"
Similarly we have `mul_succ`
but we're going to need `succ_mul` (guess what it says -- maybe you
are getting the hang of Lean's naming conventions).

The last level from addition world might help you in this level.
If you can't remember what it is, you can go back to the
home screen by clicking the house icon and then taking a look.
You won't lose any progress.

LemmaDoc MyNat.succ_mul as "succ_mul" in "Mul" "
`succ_mul a b` is the proof that `succ a * b = a * b + b`.

It could be deduced from `mul_succ` and `mul_comm`, however this argument
would be circular because the proof of `mul_comm` uses `mul_succ`.
