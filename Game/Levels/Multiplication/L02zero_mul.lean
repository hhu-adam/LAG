Introduction
"
Our first challenge is `mul_comm x y : x * y = y * x`,
and we want to prove it by induction. The zero
case will need `mul_zero` (which we have)
and `zero_mul` (which we don't), so let's
start with this.

`zero_mul x` is the proof that `0 * x = 0`.

Note: `zero_mul` is a `simp` lemma.
